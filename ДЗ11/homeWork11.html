			<p>The kitchen is the most interesting and "strategically" important object of any apartment, which is important to pay special attention to when decorating. Its interior should not only be beautiful and original, but also convenient for cooking and eating, as well as functional for storing things. Well-designed interiors and furnishings increase the comfort of being in the kitchen and contribute to an increase in appetite.
			The choice of kitchen furniture is of great importance: it should be functional and comfortable items. It is recommended to choose materials with a finish made of plastic, chipboard, moisture-resistant coating. They resist moisture well, which is an integral feature of this room, and are also easy to clean.
			Finishing materials in the design of the kitchen are also selected with great care. They must meet the requirements of strength, durability and hygiene. Ceramic tiles or wall panels are ideal for wall decoration, and durable laminate or tiles for floors. And, of course, it is important that all the products chosen for finishing the kitchen have a common design, making up a single ensemble. They can be united by a similar or, on the contrary, a contrasting color, a single style.

			<p> The bedroom is every person's secret place. This room starts every morning and ends the whole day with it. After all the day's bustle, you can retire to the bedroom and recuperate for another day.
		  	That is why, you just need to choose the right bedroom interior, which will not strain, but on the contrary will soothe and give you a good mood.Sometimes people do not know how to properly position the bed, so as not to further reduce the room. As a rule, most people prefer to put the bed with their back to the wall, but this is a rather commonplace option. Placing the bed by the window is a great original idea. Such a solution will not only allow not to occupy the entire space of the room, but in the morning the sun's rays will reach to the bed and cheer up.
			Bedroom design is a matter of taste. It does not matter that the bedroom is small, since everyone can make the room visually larger and more spacious. The main thing is comfort. If the room does not constrain, it is pleasant to go there and spend time, then everything is done correctly.
